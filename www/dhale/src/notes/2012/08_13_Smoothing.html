<h3>My favorite ten-line computer program</h3>
<p>August 13, 2012</p>
<p>
I write a lot of <a href="jtk/index.html">software</a>, 
but here is my favorite ten-line program:
</p><pre><code>
  float b = 1.0f-a;
  float sx = 1.0f, sy = a;
  float yi = 0.0f;
  y[0] = yi = sy*yi+sx*x[0];
  for (int i=1; i&lt;n-1; ++i)
    y[i] = yi = a*yi+b*x[i];
  sx /= 1.0f+a; sy /= 1.0f+a;
  y[n-1] = yi = sy*yi+sx*x[n-1];
  for (int i=n-2; i&gt;=0; --i)
    y[i] = yi = a*yi+b*y[i];
</code></pre><p>
Simon Luo, a Mines graduate student, recently helped to remove some
clutter in a slightly longer version that I wrote awhile ago.
Yes, we are cheating a little bit by putting two statements on one line,
but our program still looks clean, with plenty of symmetry that makes us
feel good.
Besides, a real cheater would write this code in a one-line program!
</p><p>
This program is valid in the programming languages Java, C++, and 
(with a few minor changes) C.
The program inputs are a <code>float</code> parameter <code>a</code> 
and a sequence of <code>n float</code> values <code>x[i]</code>, 
for <code>i = 0, 1, ..., n-1</code>.
The program output is a sequence of <code>n float</code> values 
<code>y[i]</code> with the same length.
Before I explain why this is my favorite ten-line program, let's 
first look at an example of what it does.
</p><p>
In the following figure, the input sequence <code>x</code> in red 
was recorded in a lab experiment.
We suspect that the rapid fluctuations are noise, because they do not 
fit any reasonable model of the signal we were expecting.
The output sequence <code>y</code> (black) computed with our 
ten-line program better approximates the expected signal.

  <dd><em>
    A noisy input sequence (red) after smoothing (black)
    with the ten-line program.
  </em></dd>
</dl><p>
Each output value <code>y[i]</code> is a weighted average of 
input values <code>x[j]</code>. 
The weights are proportional to <code>a<sup>|i-j|</sup></code>, so 
that (for <code>0 &lt;= a &lt;= 1</code>) they decrease exponentially 
with increasing <code>|i-j|</code>.
In this example, the parameter <code>a = 0.932</code>.
</p><p>
In effect, our ten-line program is a smoothing filter.
The weights are normalized so that they sum to one, which means that
when this filter is applied to a sequence with constant input value 
<code>x[i] = constant</code> (already as smooth as can be), the output 
values will be the same <code>y[i] = constant</code>.
</p><p>
The following figure illustrates weights for the exponential filter
and two alternative smoothing filters with comparable widths.
</p><dl class="img first">
  <dt><img src="images/smoothimp.png" width="540" alt=""/></dt>
  <dd><em>
    Impulse responses of exponential (black), Gaussian (blue) and
    boxcar (red) smoothing filters. 
    For these filters, each output sample is a weighted average of 
    nearby input samples; shown here are the weights.
  </em></dd>
</dl><p>
All three of these smoothing filters can be implemented efficiently,
with computational cost that is independent of their width.
But efficient (recursive) implementations of both the Gaussian and 
boxcar filters require more complex programs, especially when 
carefully handling the ends of input and output sequences.
</p><p>
A less efficient (non-recursive) but simpler implementation of the 
boxcar filter is often used, perhaps because it more obviously
computes a moving average.
But the abrupt transition from non-zero weight to zero weight makes no 
sense for such an average, and it is hard to beat the simplicity of our 
ten-line program.
</p><p>
To summarize, the exponential filter
</p><ul>
<li>
gives more weight to input samples located (in time or space) near
the output sample than to input samples located farther away
<li>
guarantees that all weights are non-negative, unlike many recursive 
implementations of Gaussian filters
<li>
can be applied in-place, so that output values <code>y[i]</code>
replace input values <code>x[i]</code> stored in the same array, which 
is especially useful when filtering large arrays of arrays that consume
a lot of memory
<li>
requires only six floating-point operations (multiplies and adds) 
per output sample <code>y[i]</code>, and this computational cost 
is independent of the extent of smoothing
<li>
can be implemented with a simple ten-line computer program that 
includes careful treatment of the ends of input and output sequences
</ul><p>
Careful treatment of the ends is important. 
When averaging input values to compute output values near the ends, 
our ten-line program listed above implicitly assumes that input 
values beyond the ends are equal to the end values.
This <em>zero-slope</em> assumption is often appropriate.
</p><p>
Another common assumption is that input values beyond the ends are zero,
and the figure below shows how this <em>zero-value</em> assumption may be 
inappropriate, as the decrease in the output sequence near time zero seems
inaccurate.
</p><dl class="img first">

  <dd><em>
    A noisy input sequence (red) after smoothing (black)
    with the recursive two-sided exponential filter.
    Input values off the ends have been assumed to be zero, which 
    seems unreasonable for the left end where times are nearly zero.
  </em></dd>
</dl><p>
But suppose that the data we are smoothing are known to have zero mean.
In this case, the zero-value assumption may be more appropriate, and our
ten-line program becomes
</p><pre><code>
  float b = 1.0f-a;
  float sx = b, sy = a;
  float yi = 0.0f;
  y[0] = yi = sy*yi+sx*x[0];
  for (int i=1; i&lt;n-1; ++i)
    y[i] = yi = a*yi+b*x[i];
  sx /= 1.0f+a; sy /= 1.0f+a;
  y[n-1] = yi = sy*yi+sx*x[n-1];
  for (int i=n-2; i&gt;=0; --i)
    y[i] = yi = a*yi+b*y[i];
</code></pre><p>
Can you see the difference? 
It is not obvious, but look carefully at the second line.
That's it! 
A simple change to the initialization of one variable switches 
our treatment of the ends from zero-slope to zero-value.
</p><p>
One final tip.
The relationship between the extent of smoothing and the 
parameter <code>a</code> is not at all intuitive, 
so I rarely specify this parameter directly.
Instead, I compute the parameter <code>a</code> to obtain
an exponential filter that (for low frequencies) is comparable to
a Gaussian filter with a specified half-width <code>sigma</code>
(measured in samples), using:
</p><pre><code>
  float ss = sigma*sigma;
  float a = (1.0f+ss-sqrt(1.0f+2.0f*ss))/ss;
</code></pre><p>
So, in practice, this adds two lines to our ten-line program.
And if you would rather think in terms of the integer half-width 
<code>m</code> of a boxcar filter, then (again, for low frequencies)
the half-width <code>sigma</code> of the comparable Gaussian filter 
can be computed using:
</p><pre><code>
  float sigma = sqrt(m*(m+1)/3.0f);
</code></pre><p>
For the boxcar filter with half-width <code>m = 10</code> 
displayed in the figure above, these expressions yield 
<code>sigma = 6.06</code> and <code>a = 0.792</code>.
