<h3>Parallel loops with fork-join</h3>
<p>November 28, 2010</p>
<p>
Almost five years ago I described a 
<a href="notebook.html#2006_07_29">
template for implementing parallel loops
</a> 
in Java using the standard Java class <code>AtomicInteger</code>.
I have used that template to enhance the performance on multicore
systems of about a dozen loops within the
<a href="jtk/index.html">Mines Java Toolkit</a>.
In doing so I encountered three shortcomings.
</p><p>
First, the boilerplate code required to construct and synchronize
threads was lengthy. 
A loop had to be really important for me to spend the effort writing 
&mdash; usually, I copied, pasted, and modified &mdash; that code.
Second, it was difficult for me to know how many threads to create
in my methods because I could not know how many threads would be
created in the methods that called mine.
And third, as the number of cores grew &mdash; my current workstation 
has 12 cores, each capable of executing two threads concurrently &mdash;
the performance of the atomic integer template did not keep up for 
some loops, especially those with smaller bits of computation inside.
</p><p>
I recently addressed these shortcomings by adding a new class 
<code>Parallel</code> to the package <code>edu.mines.jtk.util</code>.
The 
<a href="http://dhale.github.com/jtk/api/edu/mines/jtk/util/Parallel.html">
online documentation
</a>for <code>Parallel</code> provides some simple examples of 
using it to implement parallel loops.
These examples look more or less like this:
</p><pre><code>
Parallel.loop(begin,end,step,new Parallel.LoopInt() {
  public void compute(int i) {
    // some computation that depends on index i
  }
});
</code></pre><p>
Assuming that computations for different loop indices <code>i</code>
are independent, this parallel loop is equivalent to
</p><pre><code>
for (int i=begin; i&lt;end; i+=step) {
  // some computation that depends on index i
}
</code></pre><p>
Here let's use a different example to highlight advantages in 
using the new class <code>Parallel</code> for parallel loops.
</p>

<h4>The matrix multiplication example</h4><p>
To understand the class <code>Parallel</code> and the problems that 
it solves, let's consider the following method that computes the 
<code>j</code>'th column in a matrix product C = A&times;B:
</p><pre><code>
static void computeColumn(
  int j, float[][] a, float[][] b, float[][] c) 
{
  int ni = c.length;
  int nk = b.length;
  for (int i=0; i&lt;ni; ++i) {
    float cij = 0.0f;
    for (int k=0; k&lt;nk; ++k)
      cij += a[i][k]*b[k][j];
    c[i][j] = cij;
  }
}
</code></pre><p>
For clarity let's ignore various optimizations that we would 
normally make within this method, and instead focus on the
method that will call this one, the method with the loop over 
<code>j</code> that will compute all of the columns of the 
matrix product C.
</p><p>
The simplest loop computes columns of C serially, that is, one
after the other:
</p><pre><code>
int nj = c[0].length;
for (int j=0; j&lt;nj; ++j)
  computeColumn(j,a,b,c);
</code></pre><p>
Of course, this single-threaded loop will run no faster on a 
multi-core system than on a single-core system.
</p>

<h4>Multithreading with <code>AtomicInteger</code></h4><p>
One way to speed up this computation on multi-core systems is to 
execute multiple threads that compute columns of C in parallel.
Little synchronization between threads is required, because each 
column of the matrix product C can be computed <em>independently</em>.
</p><pre><code>
int nthread = numberOfCores();
final int nj = c[0].length;
final AtomicInteger aj = new AtomicInteger();
Thread[] threads = new Thread[nthread];
for (int ithread=0; ithread&lt;nthread; ++ithread) {
  threads[ithread] = new Thread(new Runnable() {
    public void run() {
      for (int j=aj.getAndIncrement(); j&lt;nj; 
               j=aj.getAndIncrement())
        computeColumn(j,a,b,c);
    }
  });
}
startAndJoin(threads);
</code></pre><p>
The loop over column index <code>j</code> is almost concealed by the 
numerous lines of code required to construct and synchronize threads.
I have reduced the number of lines somewhat by assuming the 
existence of some utility methods <code>numberOfCores</code> and 
<code>startAndJoin</code>, but this multi-threaded loop is still 
much more complex than the serial loop above.
</p><p>
Another complication lies in the use of the standard Java class
<code>AtomicInteger</code> which ensures that only one thread at a
time can get and increment the column index <code>j</code>.
Access to this index is <em>synchronized</em>; and although 
<code>AtomicInteger</code> is designed to be fast, this 
synchronized access will eventually become a bottleneck for 
parallel loops, as the number of threads (cores) increases.
This bottleneck will be most noticeable for small matrices,
for which synchronization time may be a significant fraction
of the time required for multiplication.
</p><p>
Yet another potential source of inefficiency lies in our choice for
the number of threads.
Suppose that some users of our method for matrix multiplication
have many matrix products to compute, and that they are unaware
that our method is implemented with multi-threading.
They might then call our method in an outer parallel loop over 
matrix products that is implemented much like our example above.
They too will execute multiple threads for their outer loop.
If they choose N = number of threads = number of cores, then the 
composite program will be executing at least N&times;N threads, 
all fighting each other for time and memory on N cores.
</p><p>
One solution to this problem of <em>nested parallelism</em> 
would be to clearly document the fact that our method for
matrix multiplication is multi-threaded.
This documentation would then serve as a warning to others to not 
execute threads in outer loops that would compete with ours.
Alternatively, we could implement both serial and parallel methods
for matrix multiplication, and let users decide which method to use.
</p><p>
Neither solution works well for a toolkit like ours, in which
ignorance of implementation is a desirable feature of reusable
software components.
Although our source code is freely available, we must be able to 
change the implementation of our methods without causing users of 
those methods to change their programs.
</p>

<h4>Multitasking with fork-join</h4><p>
In summary, the three problems I encountered with the atomic 
integer multi-threading template listed above are (1) software 
complexity, (2) performance degradation caused by synchronized 
access to a shared loop index, and (3) excessive thread 
construction due to nested parallelism.
</p><p>
All three problems are addressed by the new class <code>Parallel</code>.
Using one method and an interface defined within this class, our loop
for matrix multiplication becomes:
</p><pre><code>
int nj = c[0].length;
Parallel.loop(nj,new Parallel.LoopInt() {
  public void compute(int j) {
    computeColumn(j,a,b,c);
  }
});
</code></pre><p>
The method <code>Parallel.loop</code> is overloaded to accept
multiple parameters that describe the indices to be passed to
the method <code>compute</code> defined by the interface
<code>Parallel.LoopInt</code>.
Here, we use the default begin index 0 and the default step 1,
and specify only the end index <code>nj</code>, so that values 
<code>j = 0, 1, 2, ..., nj-1</code> (not necessarily in that order)
will be passed to the method <code>compute</code>.
That method implements the computation performed by the body of 
our parallel loop.
</p><p>
<em>
In hindsight, I should have written a class like <code>Parallel</code> 
long ago to simplify the lengthy atomic integer template listed above.
</em>
</p><p>
The method <code>loop</code> in such a class would construct and
synchronize all of the threads, and an internal hidden implemention of
<code>Thread.run</code> would simply pass the atomic integer loop 
index <code>j</code> to the user's method <code>compute</code>.
However, the method <code>Parallel.loop</code> does not work this way.
</p><p>
Instead, this method recursively subdivides the specified set of 
loop indices into two subsets of indices.
Each subset is represented by a task (not a thread) that is either
split again into two tasks or performed immediately by calling
the user's implementation of <code>compute</code> for each
index within its set.
This recursive subdivision of tasks creates a binary tree of
computation that can be performed efficiently by a 
<em>fork-join framework</em>.
</p><p>
That fork-join framework was developed by Doug Lea (1999, Concurrent
Programming in Java: Design Principles and Patterns, Addison Wesley;
see also
<a href="http://gee.cs.oswego.edu/dl/papers/fj.pdf">
A Java Fork/Join Framework
</a>)
and is scheduled to be included with Java 7 in 2011.
This framework assigns tasks to a pool of threads in a clever way 
that is designed to keep all threads busy executing the user's 
compute method, while minimizing overhead and synchronization.
Neither threads nor tasks share the loop index, so no 
synchronized access to an atomic integer is required.
</p><p>
Moreover, before a task splits itself into two smaller tasks, it
first queries the framework for an estimate of the number of excess 
tasks already constructed and for which no threads are currently 
available to execute them.
If that number exceeds a threshold (say, 6), the task does not split; 
rather, it simply performs its computation serially by calling the 
user's method <code>compute</code> for each of its loop indices. 
</p><p>
This query-before-splitting tactic solves neatly the problem of 
nested parallelism.
Tasks for inner loops will rarely be split when executed by
tasks constructed for outer loops, because the outer loops
provide sufficient tasks to keep all threads busy.
</p>

<h4>If not Java, ...</h4><p>
The key to performance in the class <code>Parallel</code> 
lies in its focus on tasks instead of threads.
<code>Parallel</code> lets a (soon-to-be standard) Java fork-join 
framework construct a shared pool of threads in which tasks can be 
executed in parallel.
The same task-based parallelism can be found in frameworks developed 
for other programming languages.
</p><p>
For example, the <a href="http://openmp.org/">OpenMP</a> standard 
specifies task-based parallelism via language extensions for 
C/C++ and Fortran.
OpenMP requires a compiler that supports the extensions, but the 
free GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) does so, as do commercial 
compilers available from Intel and others.
</p><p>
For C++, Intel provides the
<a href="http://www.threadingbuildingblocks.org/">
Threading Building Blocks (TBB)
</a> 
library that is based, in part, on task-based fork-join parallelism. 
The TBB library also supports more general patterns beyond loops
for parallel computing, and some of these may be added to the class 
<code>Parallel</code> in the future.
