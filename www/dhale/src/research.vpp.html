    A new method for processing 3D seismic images yields images of
    fault likelihoods and corresponding fault strikes and dips.
    A second process automatically extracts from those images
    fault surfaces represented by meshes of quadrilaterals.
    A third process uses differences between seismic image sample
    values alongside those fault surfaces to automatically estimate 
    fault throw vectors.
    While some of the faults found in one 3D seismic image have an 
    unusual conical shape, displays of unfaulted images illustrate 
    the fidelity of the estimated fault surfaces and fault throw 
    vectors.

Dynamic warping of seismic images

    The problem of estimating relative time (or depth) shifts between two 
    seismic images is ubiquitous in seismic data processing.
    This problem is especially difficult where shifts are large 
    and vary rapidly with time and space, and where images are 
    contaminated with noise.
    I propose a solution to this problem that is a simple extension of
    the classic dynamic time warping algorithm for speech recognition.
    This new <em>dynamic image warping</em> method for estimating shifts is 
    more accurate than methods based on crosscorrelation of windowed images 
    where shifts vary significantly within the windows.

    Bilateral filtering is widely used to enhance photographic
    images, but in most implementations is poorly suited to
    seismic images. A bilateral filter consists of two filter
    kernels. By replacing one of those kernels with a smoothing
    filter that conforms to image structures, we obtain a
    bilateral filter suitable for seismic image processing.
    Examples and comparison with conventional edge-preserving
    smoothing illustrate both advantages and disadvantages of
    structure-oriented bilateral filtering.

    In blended-neighbor interpolation of scattered data, a
    tensor field represents a model of spatial correlation that
    is both anisotropic and spatially varying. In effect, this
    tensor field defines a non-Euclidean metric, a measure of
    distance that varies with direction and location. The
    tensors may be derived from secondary data, such as images.
  <dd>
  </dd>
    Alternatively, when the primary data to be interpolated are
    measured on a non-planar surface, the tensors may be
    derived from surface geometry, and the non-Euclidean
    measure of distance is simply geodesic. Interpolation of
    geophysical data acquired on a non-planar surface should be
    consistent with tensor fields derived from both surface
    geometry and any secondary data.

    A blended neighbor method for image-guided interpolation enables 
    resampling of borehole data onto a uniform 3D sampling grid,
    without picking horizons and without flattening seismic images.
    Borehole measurements gridded in this way become new 3D images of

    The freely available Teapot Dome data set, which includes a 3D seismic 
    image, horizons picked from that image, and numerous well logs, 
    provides an ideal demonstration of image-guided interpolation of

    In this example, seismic horizons picked by others coincide with thin

    Uniformly sampled images are often used to interpolate other data acquired 
    more sparsely with an entirely different mode of measurement.
    For example, downhole tools enable geophysical properties to be measured
    with high precision near boreholes that are scattered spatially, 
    and less precise seismic images acquired at the earth's surface are used 
    to interpolate those properties at locations far away from the boreholes.
    <em>Image-guided interpolation</em> is designed specifically to enhance 
    this process.
  </dd>
  <dd>
    Most existing methods for interpolation require distances from points
    where data will be interpolated to nearby points where data are known.
    Image-guided interpolation requires non-Euclidean distances in metric 
    tensor fields that represent the coherence, orientations and shapes
    of features in images.
    This requirement leads to a new method for interpolating scattered data 
    that I call <em>blended neighbor interpolation</em>.
    For simple Euclidean distances, blended neighbor interpolation resembles 
    the classic natural neighbor interpolation.

Structure-oriented smoothing and semblance

    Smoothing along structures apparent in seismic images can enhance these 
    structural features while preserving important discontinuities such as 
    faults or channels.
    Filters appropriate for such smoothing must seamlessly adapt to 
    variations in the orientation and coherence of image features.
    I describe an implementation of smoothing filters that does this 
    and is both computationally efficient and simple to implement.
  </dd>
  <dd>
    Structure-oriented filters lead naturally to the computation of 
    structure-oriented semblance, an attribute commonly used to
    highlight discontinuities in seismic images.
    Semblance is defined in this paper as simply the ratio of a 
    squared smoothed-image to a smoothed squared-image.
    This definition of semblance generalizes that commonly used today,
    because an unlimited variety of smoothing filters can be used to 
    compute the numerator and denominator images in the semblance ratio.
    The smoothing filters described in this paper yield an especially 
    flexible method for computing structure-oriented semblance.

Apparent horizontal displacements

    In addition to vertical time shifts commonly observed in time-lapse 
    seismic images, horizontal displacements are apparent as well.
    These apparent horizontal displacements may be small relatively to seismic
    wavelengths, perhaps only 5 m at depths of 5 km, but they consistently 
    suggest an outward lateral expansion of images away from a compacting 
    reservoir.
  </dd>
  <dd>
    It is well known that apparent vertical displacements are caused mostly 
    by a decrease in seismic wave velocities above compacting reservoirs.
    Those same velocity changes contribute to horizontal displacements.
    This contribution can be computed from the velocity changes that, 
    in turn, can be estimated from measured vertical displacements.
    Horizontal displacements computed in this way are similar to those 
    measured, and this similarity suggests that horizontal as well as 
    vertical displacements may be largely due to velocity changes.

A method for estimating apparent displacement

    Reliable estimates of vertical, inline and crossline components of 
    apparent displacements in time-lapse seismic images are difficult to 
    obtain for two reasons.
    First, features in 3-D seismic images tend to be locally planar, and 
    components of displacement within the planes of such features are poorly 
    resolved. 
    Second, searching directly for peaks in 3-D cross-correlations is less 
    robust, more complicated, and computationally more costly than searching 
    for peaks of 1-D cross-correlations.
    We estimate all three components of displacement with a process designed 
    to mitigate these two problems. 
    We address the first problem by computing for each image sample a local 
    phase-correlation instead of a local cross-correlation. 
    We address the second problem with a cyclic sequence of searches for 
    peaks of correlations computed for lags constrained to one of the three 
    axes of our images.

    Local dip filters attenuate or enhance features with a specified dip 
    that may vary for each image sample. 
    Because these multi-dimensional filters change with each sample, they 
    should have a small number of coefficients that can be computed
    efficiently from local dips. 
    They should handle features that are vertical as well as horizontal. 
    They should have efficient and stable inverses that facilitate
    the design and application of more discriminate notch filters. 
    Local dip filters constructed from approximations to directional

    Gaussian or Gaussian derivative filtering is in several ways optimal

    For short filters with lengths of a dozen samples or so, 
    direct convolution with a finite-length approximation to a Gaussian

    However, for longer filters such as those used in computing running

    A first step in seismic interpretation is seismic image segmentation.
    For most seismic images, with incompletely or poorly imaged faults and 
    horizons, global methods for segmentation are more robust than local 
    event tracking or region growing methods often used today.
    The disadvantage of global image segmentation methods has been their 
    relatively high computational cost.
    We reduce this cost by applying these methods to a space-filling mesh 
    aligned automatically with features in seismic images.
    The mesh makes global segmentation of 3-D seismic images feasible.

    Connecting these points yields an unstructured space-filling polyhedral 
    (atomic) mesh. 
    This single data structure can integrate multiple tasks, such as seismic 
    interpretation, reservoir characterization, and flow simulation, thereby 
    reducing work cycle times and errors.

    Seismically imaged horizons and faults often correspond to 
    discontinuities in subsurface properties, such as permeability.
    We automatically align a lattice of points (atoms) either on or 
    alongside such features.
    3-D Delaunay triangulation of atoms aligned <em>on</em> image 
    features yields a tetrahedral mesh, with triangular faces of 
    tetrahedra coincident with subsurface discontinuities.
    Alternatively, the same triangulation of atoms aligned 
    <em>alongside</em> image features yields a dual Voronoi polyhedral 
    mesh in which polygonal faces coincide with subsurface discontinuities.
    Either mesh is suitable for fluid flow simulation.

<h3>Atomic images &mdash; a method for meshing digital images</h3>

    By combining a digital image with a lattice of points called 
    <em>atoms</em>, in which atom coordinates are computed to minimize 
    a potential energy function of the combination, we obtain a mesh 
    suitable for further computations.
    Each atom in the lattice contributes a potential function to an 
    atomic potential field. 
    The image represents another potential field. 
    Total potential energy of the lattice is a weighted sum of the 
    atomic and image potential fields, evaluated at atom coordinates. 
    Beginning with a pseudo-regular lattice, a generic optimization 
    algorithm moves atoms to minimize this total potential energy.
    After optimization, we connect the atoms to form a mesh that tends 
    to be aligned with image features.
