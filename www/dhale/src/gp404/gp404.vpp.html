<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>
We live in a digital world.
Speech, image, video, almost any signals worth recording today are sampled
functions of time, space, or both.
In this course, we learn the special characteristics of these digital 
signals, and how to analyze and enhance them with computers.
</p>
<p>
We will focus on four aspects of digital signal processing:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Convolutional (FIR - finite impulse response) filters</li>
  <li>Recursive (IIR - infinite impulse response) filters</li>
  <li>Sinc interpolation of bandlimited signals</li>
  <li>Discrete Fourier transforms</li>
</ul>
<p>
For each aspect, we will study existing industrial-strength
computer programs, write simpler programs ourselves, and then
use these programs to process various digital signals.
</p>

<h3>Time and place</h3>
<p>
  Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, 10:00-10:50 am; GC 215/297
</p>

<h3>Grading</h3>
<p>
Your grade is based on
</p>
<ul>
  <li>10%: classwork</li>
  <li>15%: homework and labs</li>
  <li>50%: midterm exams (two)</li>
  <li>25%: final exam</li>
</ul>
<p>
Homework and labs are discussed, graded and returned promptly, 
and only work submitted on time will be accepted for grading.
Assistance from others on labs and homework is permitted under the 
following conditions: 
(1) those providing assistance <em>must not share</em> their 
computer programs or solutions, and 
(2) recipients <em>must acknowledge any assistance</em> in all 
work submitted.

<h3 class="newpage">Student absences from class, labs, or exams</h3>
All students are advised to be familiar with CSMâ€™s policy regarding 
the make-up of work missed due to excused absences.  
This policy may be found in the Bulletin.  
If a student is ill and exhibits flu-like symptoms, they should not 
attend class, labs, or exams.  
For this particular flu season, the Centers for Disease Control are 
discouraging those who are ill and without serious complications from 
visiting a health clinic or physician thus it will be difficult for 
students to obtain written documentation of their illness for the 
Associate Dean of Students and for faculty. In order for an absence 
based on illness to be excused, the student must normally communicate 
directly with the Associate Dean of Students or his/her instructors.  
To make this notification process easier, particularly in the case of 
students suffering flu-like symptoms, we have created a web-based 
certification system, and strongly encourage students to use this system 
to automatically notify all of their instructors regarding their illness.  
Here is a link to this
